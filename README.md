This image is based on [ruby:alpine](https://hub.docker.com/_/ruby) with [Phusion Passenger Standalone](https://www.phusionpassenger.com/library/config/standalone/) added. It is built nightly, but there are currently no tests nor is it automatically versioned. If you know how to add these and have time, feel free to submit a PR.

Available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/tiltcamp/ruby-alpine-passenger) and the [GitHub Package Repository](https://github.com/tiltcamp/ruby-alpine-passenger/packages/212448).
